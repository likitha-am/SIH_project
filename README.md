## AI-Driven Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) for Power Transformers
SIH 2025 – Grand Finale Project(held at Marri Laxmi Institute of technology and management, Hyderabad)
## Project Overview

Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is a vital diagnostic technique used to evaluate the mechanical and electrical condition of power transformers. Conventional FRA analysis relies heavily on expert interpretation and multiple fragmented tools, making the process slow and subjective.

This project introduces a unified AI-driven software platform that automates FRA analysis using machine learning to detect transformer faults efficiently and accurately.

Developed as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025 (Grand Finale), the solution aims to modernize transformer health assessment for power utilities.
